    <h2 style="text-align: center">What method did Gandhi use?:</h2> <br> <p style="text-align: center">Gandhi used a march to protest, this method works because it takes a long time so it has time to gain attention from the media, and other people. It also is peaceful so if something is done vicousely durring the march is will add more fuel for people to agree with what's being protested.<h2 style="text-align: center">Strengths of this message:</h2> <p style="text-align: center"> <br> One of the strengths of this method of protest is it's peaceful so if anything happens to the protestors that's violent it will make other people believe in their cause. Another strength is that a walk is long so it will have a long time to gain attention from media and other people, building the backing to their cause.<h2 style="text-align: center">Weaknesses of this method:</h2> <p style="text-align: center"> <br>If someone else tries to fight you you have to just sit there and take them assaulting you because if you retaliated they would have more of a reason to act violently.</p>
